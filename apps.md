⚗️ Solvent Mixture Calculator


🧪 Solvent Mixture Calculator

A clean, intuitive web-based tool designed for chemists, researchers, and students to quickly determine the exact volumes required for multi-component solvent systems.

🌟 The Vision
In a laboratory setting, precision is paramount. This project was born from a desire to move away from manual scratchpad calculations and create a reliable, digital companion for the bench. 

The best part? This tool was developed by a Chemist using AI collaboration—proving that you don't need to be a software engineer to build impactful digital tools for the scientific community.

🚀 Features
* Multi-Solvent Support: Handle up to four different solvents simultaneously.
* Percentage-Based Logic:Input your desired ratios and get instant volumetric results.
* Responsive Design: Optimized for mobile use via TrebEdit, making it perfect for use on a smartphone or tablet right at the fume hood.
  *Error Reduction:Minimizes human calculation errors in solvent preparation.

📊 How It Works
The calculator uses a straightforward volumetric logic. Given a set of percentages $P_1, P_2, ... P_n$ and a target total volume $V_{total}$, it calculates the required volume for each solvent $V_s$ using the formula:

$$V_s = \frac{P_n}{100} \times V_{total}$$

 User Steps:
1.  Set Mode:Select "Percentage" mode.
2.  Input Ratios:Enter the percentage for each solvent (e.g., 12.5%, 43.5%, etc.).
3.  Define Total Volume:Enter the final amount of mixture you need (e.g., 750 mL).
4.  Calculate:Get an instant breakdown of every milliliter required.
