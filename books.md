Synopsis:

The End of Medicine, the Beginning of Connection
​In the remote village of Kedar, an ancient Banyan tree—Vat-Pitamah—holds a secret that defies modern science. When a dying boy is miraculously cured by simply breathing against its bark, the world’s attention turns to this "miracle".  
​Dr. Alok, a skeptical immunologist, discovers that the tree isn't providing a drug; it's delivering a quantum-coded molecular switch called Substance-V that triggers the human body to heal itself. As the secret of the "Twelve Breaths" protocol leaks, the peaceful forest becomes the epicenter of a global war between humanitarian hope and corporate greed. Can humanity protect the ultimate cure, or will the "Arbor Vitae" be destroyed by the very world it was meant to save?

Read an Excerpt 📖

The First Connection
​"Rohan’s hands flattened onto the ridged bark. He looked like a small, broken circuit attempting to plug into a massive power source.
​'One,' the Shaman counted softly. Rohan drew a ragged breath, the deep inhale scraping at his dry throat.
​'Two.' The second breath was marginally steadier.
​The process was slow, meditative. The air beneath the Banyan seemed different, cleaner, heavier, carrying an almost imperceptible scent of earth and chlorophyll. Lekh watched his son’s chest rise and fall, rise and fall.
​By the time the Shaman counted 'Twelve,' Rohan’s breathing was deep, measured, and rhythmic. He slowly opened his eyes, pulled his hands away from the bark, and turned."  

🔭 Writing Philosophy

My work bridges the gap between the precision of the pharmaceutical industry and the limitless possibilities of the future. I believe Sci-Fi is a mirror that allows us to see our current world more clearly.
